      <p> Hey! My name is Austin Waterman. I'm 20 years old and I live in Denver, Colorado.</p>

        <h3 class="align-center">All About Me!</h3>
        <p>I was previously in college for mechanical engineering, but I’ve made the jump to software engineering as I think that’s the best fit for me. I’ve been interested in computers and technology all my life.</p> 
        <p>I started with upgrading the family computer so I could play Minecraft, and it all kicked off from there! In middle school, I originally wanted to be game developer, but with time software engineering has grown on me. Enrolling in the Thinkful Engineering Immersion course is my next big step to becoming the developer I want to be!</p>
        <p>If you’re looking for a new software developer to add to your team, just some one to code jam with, feel free to contact me! I’m looking to talk with other developers about programming or work together on some new and innovative projects!</p>
